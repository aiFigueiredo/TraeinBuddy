## TraeinBuddy

Example Project of a train schedule app that uses the Irishrail.ie public API.
It was written in Swift using the VIPER architectural pattern.

This project was based on a lot of research and inspired by a few other example apps that use VIPER like [this one from MindorksOpenSource](https://github.com/MindorksOpenSource/iOS-Viper-Architecture) and [this one from MutualMobile](https://github.com/mutualmobile/VIPER-SWIFT).

## TODO
- [ ] Join StationList and TrainList module by creating a layer of abstraction for differences in dependencies
- [ ] Create an abstraction between UITableViewCell and UITableViewController for better reusability
- [ ] Add Unit Tests
- [ ] Add UI Tests
- [ ] Overall code improvements
- [ ] Improve UI/UX
