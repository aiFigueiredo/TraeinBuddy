## TraeinBuddy

Example Project of a train schedule app that uses Irishrail.ie public API.
It was written in Swift using VIPER architectural pattern.

This project was based on a lot of research and inspired in a few other example apps that used VIPER like [this one from MindorksOpenSource](https://github.com/MindorksOpenSource/iOS-Viper-Architecture) and [this one from MutualMobile](https://github.com/mutualmobile/VIPER-SWIFT).
